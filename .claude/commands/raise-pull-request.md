Raise a pull request for the branch the user is on.

Follow this guidance:

- If the user is on the master branch DO NOTHING.
- If the user requests the pull request to be raised as a draft, do so, draft PRs should include /uncc to avoid requesting reviews.

Once you have all of the required information, create the pull request using this repositories PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md found in the `.github` directory, if present.

Be consice in your summary / pull request description. The intended audience is end-users and developers.
