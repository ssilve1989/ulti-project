# API Migration Documentation

This directory contains phase-specific documentation for migrating from the current mock data system to a dependency-injected API interface architecture.

## Overview

The migration is broken down into 6 distinct phases, each with its own documentation and implementation guide. Each phase builds upon the previous one while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Phase Structure

Each phase document contains:

- **Context**: Current state and goals
- **Requirements**: Technical specifications and constraints
- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for AI implementation
- **Validation**: Testing and completion criteria
- **Dependencies**: Files and types needed from shared package

## Migration Phases

### [Phase 1: API Interface Layer](./phase-1-interfaces.md) (2-3 days)

Create abstract TypeScript interfaces and dependency injection infrastructure.

- **Input**: Current `schedulingApi.ts` and shared package types
- **Output**: Interface definitions and factory pattern
- **Status**: Updated to evolutionary approach

### [Phase 2: Mock Enhancement](./phase-2-mock-implementations.md) (2-3 days)

Enhance existing mock functions to implement Phase 1 interfaces with guild context.

- **Input**: Existing `lib/mock/*` files and Phase 1 interfaces
- **Output**: Enhanced mock functions with class wrappers implementing interfaces
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1
- **Strategy**: Evolutionary enhancement preserving existing functionality

### [Phase 3: HTTP API Implementation](./phase-3-http-stubs.md) (1-2 days)

Create production-ready HTTP implementation for seamless backend integration.

- **Input**: Phase 1 interfaces and enhanced mock architecture
- **Output**: Production-ready HTTP API classes with full functionality
- **Dependencies**: Phase 2
- **Strategy**: Complete HTTP client with authentication, error handling, and retry logic

### [Phase 4: API Client Integration](./phase-4-client-update.md) (1 day)

Create unified client that integrates enhanced mock system with new architecture.

- **Input**: Phases 1-3 implementations
- **Output**: New API client with backward compatibility preserving enhanced mock features
- **Dependencies**: Phases 1-3
- **Strategy**: Gradual integration maintaining sophisticated mock capabilities

### [Phase 5: Environment & Testing](./phase-5-environment-testing.md) (1-2 days)

Set up environment-based switching and comprehensive testing with enhanced mock validation.

- **Input**: Phase 4 client and enhanced mock system
- **Output**: Environment configuration and testing suite validating enhanced mock features
- **Dependencies**: Phase 4
- **Strategy**: Comprehensive testing of SSE, session persistence, and realistic data

### [Phase 6: Integration Finalization](./phase-6-cleanup.md) (1 day)

Finalize integration and establish progressive migration path.

- **Input**: Completed Phase 5 with environment testing
- **Output**: Clean, production-ready API architecture with preserved mock features
- **Dependencies**: All previous phases
- **Strategy**: Progressive hook migration and cleanup of temporary artifacts

## Migration Strategy: Evolutionary Enhancement

**Key Change**: The migration plan has been updated to use an **evolutionary enhancement approach** instead of complete rebuilding.

**Rationale**: The existing mock system is already sophisticated with:

- Guild-aware infrastructure
- Advanced SSE simulation and conflict handling
- Comprehensive helper availability and absence management
- Realistic data with sophisticated scheduling scenarios

**Benefits**:

- ✅ **Zero Regression Risk**: Preserve all existing functionality
- ✅ **Faster Implementation**: Leverage proven mock logic and realistic data
- ✅ **Reduced Complexity**: Enhance rather than rebuild sophisticated features
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API calls during transition

**Updated Approach**:

- **Phase 1**: Create interface layer matching API specification with guild multi-tenancy
- **Phase 2**: Enhance existing mock functions with interface wrappers preserving sophisticated features
- **Phase 3**: Create production-ready HTTP implementations that match the enhanced mock interfaces  
- **Phase 4**: Integrate enhanced mock system with new unified client maintaining backward compatibility
- **Phase 5**: Comprehensive testing validating enhanced mock features and environment switching
- **Phase 6**: Progressive hook migration and cleanup while preserving all sophisticated functionality

## Key Principles

### Type Safety

- All implementations must use types from `@ulti-project/shared` package
- No local type definitions allowed
- TypeScript provides compile-time safety (no runtime validation needed)

### Backward Compatibility

- Each phase maintains existing functionality
- Components and hooks continue working unchanged
- Environment switching is transparent to existing code

### Quality Assurance

- Each phase has specific completion criteria
- Comprehensive testing at every stage
- Performance benchmarking throughout migration

## Getting Started

1. Read the [Project Context](./project-context.md) for background
2. Review [Shared Package Integration](./shared-package-guide.md) for type usage
3. Start with [Phase 1](./phase-1-interfaces.md) implementation
4. Follow phases sequentially for best results

## AI Implementation Notes

Each phase document is designed to provide sufficient context for AI implementation:

- Clear technical requirements and constraints
- Code examples and patterns to follow
- Specific file paths and naming conventions
- Validation criteria and testing requirements
- Dependencies and imports from shared package

The documentation assumes TypeScript expertise and familiarity with modern React/Node.js development patterns.
