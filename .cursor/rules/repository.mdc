This project is a pnpm workspaces repository.

- TypeScript is configured to expect ESM modules.
- Never use npm always use pnpm
- We use `vitest` for testing.
  - When running tests you should use `pnpm test --run` in the correct package you are testing

## Dealing with Dates
- Always use native Date objects and `date-fns` for date related functionality.
- Use `toISOString()` for serialization and deserialization of dates.
