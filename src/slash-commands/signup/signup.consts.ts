We're sorry but your signup could not currently be approved. Possible reasons include:
- Signup doesn't meet new qualifications. Check <#1074471023178686514> for the latest information

- You already cleared the encounter you signed-up for
- Mechanics prior to the requested prog point not performed cleanly
You can reach out to a coordinator to discuss any issues.
